# TensorFlow_Project
TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript Library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js.

In this repository, we have created a TensorFlow.js model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network. 
First, we trained the classifier by having it “look” at thousands of handwritten digit images and their labels. Then we evaluated the classifier's accuracy using test data that the model has never seen.

Technological stack: HTML, CSS, TensorFlow, 
JavaScript.
